# Prog_langSyntax

Prog_langSyntaxs is a project which demonstrates various languages and their 
implementation of a _Hello World!_ like app called **Hello Git** in its own
syntax.

It demonstrates how various languages implement **Hello Git**, just to
demonstrate that one major differences between different programming languages 
is their implementation of the task.

_The good thing about programming is the **Diversity** in programming_
