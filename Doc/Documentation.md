## Ease Of Implementation of the "HelloGit"

  Python, Perl, Ruby, Lua, Javascript, PHP, Matlab, Lisp OCaml even Scala (to an
  extent) share a similar style in that the "Hello Git" implentation required
  only a few commands to call like: print("Hello Git") or something similar.

## Verbose Syntax

  Java, C++, C, C#, Objective-C, Haskell, Go, D, Vala, Pascal & Rust (to 
  an extent) required much more code to implement "HelloGit"

## Comment Style

  Python, Perl, Ruby and R were similar in that category
  ` # comment ...`
  Haskell, Lua, SQL were similar
  `-- comment ...`
  C, C#, C++, D, Go, Java, Javascript, Objective-C, Rust, Scala and Vala had the
  common
  `// comments ...` 
  `/*...multiline comments */ `S
  Special Mentions go to these languages that had the strangest comment style
  Lisp       	`; comments ... `
  Matlab     	`% commments ...`
  OCaml      	`(* comments ... *)`
  Pascal     	`{ comments ... }`
  HTML       	`!-- comments ...`
  PHP was somewhat torn in the middle as it went with both
  `// comments ...`   and ` # comments ...`
