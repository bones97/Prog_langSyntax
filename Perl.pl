#!/usr/bin/perl

# Perl also in the Python and Ruby family
# Perl uses a "#" to start comments 

# Also easy to get a "Hello Git" like its brethrens 
print "Hello Git\n";

# In later versions which supports the "say" statement
use 5.010;
say "Hello Git";

# Good Perl practices requires more complex programs to add
# the "use strict;" and use "warnings;" pragrams
use strict;
use warnings;

print "Hello Git\n"
